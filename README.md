Thanks for reading me.


What is the project ?:
We are to choose an Amazon product page and copy it

How I made it:
-I chose a relativly simple page about a toothbrush
 It doesn't have a lot of details nor does it have a complex middle section with photos
-I split up the poject into multiple css files in order to make everything clean and readable for everyone, relevant file names for the sections has been chosen
- I downloaded all assets needed for the project and placed them in a directory called 'assets'
